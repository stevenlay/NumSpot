# NumSpot

A real-time multiplayer number-spotting game. Players race to find the one number shared between their card and the center card.

## How to play

1. One player creates a room and shares the room code.
2. Up to 8 players join using that code. Late joiners (or players who join a full room) enter as spectators and can convert to a player when a slot opens.
3. The host configures settings and starts the game. Each player gets their own private card; a center card is shown to everyone.
4. Each card shares exactly one number with the center card. First to tap the correct number wins the round and scores a point.
5. The game ends when all cards are played. Highest score wins. The host can restart for another round — session scores accumulate across games.

## Features

- **Lobby** — Room code sharing, live player list, spectator list, and host-only settings panel
- **Spectators** — Join any room at any time; watch from the sidelines and jump in when a slot opens
- **Host settings** — Max players (2–8), deck size (5–57 cards), wrong-claim penalty duration, correct-claim lock duration
- **Chat** — Live chat for players and spectators in both lobby and game
- **Session scores** — Cumulative scores shown in the lobby between rounds
- **Claim feedback** — Animated penalty bar on a missed claim; lock-out cooldown after a correct claim

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Node.js 24+

### Backend (Go / Gin — port 8080)

```bash
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server
```

### Frontend (React / Vite — port 5173)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The Vite dev server proxies `/ws` to the backend automatically.
